## Driving simulations
The UC-win/Road `forum8_impaired_driving_scenarios.rd` file contains three 8-minute driving tasks conducted on a bidirectional, four-lane highway with a lane width of 3.4 meters. The tasks are as follows:

### Highway driving task
In the highway drive, participants are instructed to drive at a constant speed of 100 km/h, braking & overtaking other vehicles if necessary. This task includes four over-taking events spaced evenly over the 12 km drive.

### Car-following task
The car-following task commences with a vehicle appearing approximately 50 meters in front of the participants vehicle & participants are instructed to follow & maintain a safe but constant distance (headway) to it.

<br><img width="2880" alt="Car_Following_Screenshot" src="https://github.com/blair-aitken/Forum8_Impaired_Driving/assets/131508862/2097b757-2110-4585-a6ce-ba23ecef0179"><br>

The lead vehicle accelerates or decelerates every 400 meters in a sinusoidal manner between 60 & 90 km/h, with single speed changes of no more than ± 10 km/h. Thus, participants must slow down in order to avoid collision, & to speed up in order to keep up with the leading car

### Dual task
During this task, letters ranging from A to F appear inside a green hexagon are presented on screen directly in front of the participant. As each letter appears, participants respond by quickly press the corresponding button on their dashboard & promptly return both hands to the steering wheel.

<br><img width="2880" alt="Dual_Task_Screenshot" src="https://github.com/blair-aitken/Forum8_Impaired_Driving/assets/131508862/6ad8de32-d64f-47a2-9284-e5ff6533c9bf"><br>

A total of 50 trials are presented, with each letter appearing for one second every 10 seconds. Participants are also instructed to maintain a constant speed of 100 km/h in the left lane while driving. 

### Outcomes
Six primary driving endpoints are calculated using the `forum8_impaired_driving_analysis.R` script to assess simulated driving performance. The definitions of these outcomes are as follows:
*	**SDLP**: Measured in centimetres, with an increase in SDLP indicating decreased vehicle control. To reduce the influence of intentional deviation from the lane centre, data points during lane change events marked using indicators (e.g., over-taking traffic) are removed, & only data from the target lane are included.
*	**Mean speed**: Mean speed, measured in km/h, sustained throughout the task.
*	**SDS**: The standard deviation of speed, measured in km/h, with an increase in SDS indicating an increase in speed variability.
*	**Steering variability**: The standard deviation of the steering wheel angle values ranging from 0 (absolute center) to 1 (absolute left or right) with higher values represent increased movement of the steering wheel. 
*	 **Lane deviations**: Scored as 1 each time the vehicle crossed from the driving lane into the left shoulder or right lane, excluding intentional overtaking manoeuvres.
*	**Mean Headway**: Mean distance, measured in meters, maintained between the participant’s vehicle and the lead vehicle during the car-following task.
*	**Headway variability**: The standard deviation of headway, measured in meters, with an increase in headway indicating a decreased ability to maintain a consistent distance between the lead vehicle.

Each version includes variations in lead vehicle speed for the car-following task and stimuli order for the dual task. Additionally, the appearance of other vehicles, including make, model, and color, is randomized across each version to enhance novelty. Despite these variations, the drives remain otherwise identical to ensure comparable results across versions.

Users can easily modify weather conditions, such as rain or fog, and select between daytime and nighttime driving scenarios. By default, the tasks adhere to Australian driving regulations, with participants driving in the left lane. Customized versions tailored for the United States and European Union, inclusive of local road signage, are available upon request.

## Setup
1. Use `git clone` or download the project from this page.

2. Once you have the project files on your local machine, locate the `forum8_impaired_driving_scenario.rd` file containg the UC/win-Road scenarios.

3. Open the scenario selector within the file to choose the specific task or version you want to use. The scenario selector allows you to switch between different tasks or versions available within the single  file. 

## How to run data analysis
1. UC-win/Road output files should be named using the following format:
* "STUDYCODE_000_00_T0.csv"
* Where:
  * "STUDYCODE" is the study identifier
  * "000" is the participant number (e.g., 001, 002, 003, ...)
  * "V0" is the visit number (e.g., V1, V2, V3, ...)
  * "T0" is the drive number (e.g., T1, T2, T3, ...)

2. The `forum8_impaired_driving_analysis.R` script should be placed in the same folder as all CSV data files.

3. The script reads all CSV files in the folder & groups by participant id, visit, & drive number. 

4. Summary & raw data will be saved into data folder.

## Modifying the data analysis script
The `forum8_impaired_driving_analysis.R` script is fully customizable and includes detailed comments that explain what each line of code does. This allows you to easily adapt it to your own data analysis needs. Below are key sections you may want to customize:

### 1. Handling Different File Naming Conventions
The script assumes a specific naming convention for CSV files (`STUDYCODE_000_00_T0.csv`). If your data files have a different naming convention, you'll need to modify the section that extracts information from file names. For example:

```R
# Modify the regular expressions according to your file naming convention
driving_data$id <- as.numeric(sub("^your_regular_expression_here", "\\1", driving_data$file))
driving_data$visit <- as.factor(sub("^your_regular_expression_here", "\\1", driving_data$file))
driving_data$drive_number <- as.factor(sub("^your_regular_expression_here", "\\1", driving_data$file))
```

### 2. Adding New Data Filtering Criteria
Depending on your analysis, you may need to apply different filtering criteria to the data. For example, you could add additional filters or modify existing ones in the sections where data is being cleaned and organized.

```R
# Filtering based on a custom condition
driving_data <- driving_data %>%
  filter(custom_column >= some_value)
  ```
  
### 3. Customising data export
The script exports the data in CSV format. You could modify the export section to output the data in a different format or save it to a specific location.

```R
# Exporting the data to an Excel file
library(writexl)
write_xlsx(driving_data_summary, "path_to_save_file/driving_data_summary.xlsx")
```

Remember to ensure that any additional libraries needed for your modifications are loaded at the beginning of the script.
